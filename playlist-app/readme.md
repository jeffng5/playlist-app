## Playlist-app ##


For this assessment, the biggest roadblock is I can't add to my databases! The database is set up properly with the id's autoincrementing. The forms.py file is set up properly. I followed the code exactly but cant figure it out! However once that part is cleared, the project becomes much easier. I would have a bunch of playlists to work with and also a bunch of songs to work with, with proper ids. Adding a song to the playlist would involve a POST request on add_song_to_playlist.html with form action linked to "/playlists/<int:playlist_id>". The routes are all declared in app.py and I think I would need to join the three tables and display the playlist with the songs in that playlist. I will update this ASAP! 

If I can solve or get help in posting to the database, I would have something tangible to work with and coding rest of project would be alot easier. **NEW UPDATE** I added a seed.py file to load some entries into my database to have data to work with.
